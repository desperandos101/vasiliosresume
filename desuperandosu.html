  <h4> You've fallen on tough times. You have an opportunity to help you and your family; you can pirate illegal dvds and sell them for cash.</h4>
    <h1> Should you or shouldn't you?</h1>

  <p>Let's throw some facts at ya! According to <a href="https://www.slashgear.com/piracy-is-hurting-dvd-sales-thanks-to-artificial-release-delays-03442769/"> Slashgear</a>, piracy's effect on DVD sales has more to do with the fault of the company.</p>
  <p id="info"> Now, first we need to take a look at the facts. Since we're tackling DVD piracy, we'll look at stats pertaining for that. Like for instance, the effects of staggering a movie release, which means that it wont release in all countries at the same time. This is an intentional thing companies do. Why, you ask? Well, it helps theater sales. But you know what it doesn't help? <br> DVD sales.</p>
<p> As you can see by this table, the longer a movie is staggered, the more the DVD sales will suffer. And the source of this decline could very well be just decline in interest, but the lost sales percentage becomes very large in a country like Spain, a country that has a known piracy problem.</p>

<p> Other than that fact, the effects of piracy and the money it costs is a bit of a mystery, but estimates are around 30 billion dollars in the film industry.</p>
<h3> Piracy Is Bad Argument</h3>
<p> Films and DVDs cost money to make. When a company sells a film or DVD, they are doing so in hopes that they can turn a profit. So, when a consumer can access it for free, that means that there will be less of a profit for the company. But what’s the deal, right? Usually you’ll be stealing from giant faceless corporations anyway. <br> However, behind that brand name, there are people that the company needs to pay. And if the company doesn’t have enough money to pay all their workers, they will either cut the pay or lay off workers altogether. So when you pirate, you hurt more than the company.</p>
<h3> Piracy Is Fine Argument</h3>
<p> So, say theres this movie that has released. Its marketing campaign was quite iffy. Many people simply don’t wish to commit to the option of purchasing the movie if it didn’t look that good on commercials. <br> Now say that there is this person who also did not want to commit the price. Instead, they have pirated the movie and watched it. If they heavily enjoyed it, they can recommend it to their skeptical friends. Overall, there’s a net increase in sales of the movie from this word-of-mouth interaction.</p>
