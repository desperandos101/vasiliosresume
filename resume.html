<p> I am the most hire-able man to hire <em> ever </em>.<strong> I will prove this.</strong></p>
<p> I have been to a math class 1 grade above my level (because I'm SMART!). I also excel at taking tests, and creating engaging, educational media (because I'm SMARTEREST!). My peers have commended me on my sense of humor as well. I have been cited as a positive source of energy among my peers, without being a distraction. I am well educated in French (PARCE QUE JE SAIS TOUT!!).</p>
<p> Strengths: <ul> <li> I have a math-brain. I am able to do calculations for you.<li> I will be a hard worker. <li> I am quite experienced in hardware and software alike. I have built a computer before.</ul></p>
<p> As a young child, I took Karate classes. The class teaches good reflexes, posture, and of course, martial arts. I have also been to a summer camp which promotes physical activity and patience. I have taken an online course on computer building as well. Finally, I walk the dog every day and shovel the snow, the latter being especially work-intensive.</p>
